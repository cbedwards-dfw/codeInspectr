Provided functions can read sheets of two excel files and produce a third file that highlights cells that have changed. In the case of numeric changes, the direction of change is highlighted. These tools do not account for  structural changes in the sheets (e.g., the addition of a column), but are useful in tracking changed values in tables or parameter files. Utility functions developed to streamline formatting output files are also more broadly useful in programmatically formatting excel files using openxlsx.\" #>  #> $branch_activity #>   branch most_recent_update                                              link #> 1    dev         2026-02-03  https://github.com/cbedwards-dfw/xldiff/tree/dev #> 2   main         2026-02-03 https://github.com/cbedwards-dfw/xldiff/tree/main #>  #> $issues #>                                      title #> 1 Consider better handling of text changes #> 2                 Improve input validation #> 3                      Add more unit tests #>                                                                        body #> 1 Currently xldiff does a poor job of handling sheets with many cells of... #> 2         Use new `validate_*` for cell address / addresses, excel sheets.  #> 3 At the very least, `blank_line_handling` functions should be easy to c... #>         date                                              link #> 1 2026-02-02 https://github.com/cbedwards-dfw/xldiff/issues/16 #> 2 2026-01-31 https://github.com/cbedwards-dfw/xldiff/issues/15 #> 3 2026-01-31 https://github.com/cbedwards-dfw/xldiff/issues/14 #>  #> $pull_requests #> NULL #>  #> $github_dependencies #> [1] \"JanMarvin/openxlsx2\" #>"},{"path":"https://cbedwards-dfw.github.io/codeInspectr/news/index.html","id":"codeinspectr-development-version","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"codeInspectr (development version)","title":"codeInspectr (development version)","text":"addition basic functions.
