# codeInspectr

The goal of codeInspectr is to make it easy to understand R packages and
the relationships between functions of that package. This includes tools
for looking at function dependencies within an installed package, and
summarizing information about a github repository.

## Installation

You can install the development version of codeInspectr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("cbedwards-dfw/codeInspectr")
